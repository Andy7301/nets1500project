Interactive Graph Algorithm Visualizer

Description:

This Java Swing application lets users build and explore graphs interactively.  You can click to add nodes, draw directed or undirected edges, and then run fundamental 4 graph algorithms, BFS, DFS, Dijkstra’s, and topological sort, and watch how they work step by step.  There is also a built in quiz mode that prompts the user to predict the algorithm’s output before revealing and animating the correct result.  The tool is designed as a teaching aid to deepen understanding of graph and graph algorithms (category used).

Work Breakdown:

Andy Wang - BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Graph.java, Forward/Backward step feature, Instructions box, Readme, User manual, Comments

Edward Zhang - Most of the visualizer (adding nodes and edges, connecting the algorithms to buttons, toggling between undirected/directed, toggle between weighted/unweighted, reset all)

Jereth Liu - Topo sort, Quiz functionality, fixed toggling between undirected/directed to maintain graph, fixed bfs/dfs to explore other connected components like in class
